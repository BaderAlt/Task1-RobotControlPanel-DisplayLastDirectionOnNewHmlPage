Task1.1 : I created a user interface (Robot control panel) with five buttons that express the four directions: forward, back, right, left, and finally stop. Every time the user clicks on one of those buttons, the value is stored in the database that I created and linked to it.

Task1.2 : I created a new html page that displays the last direction selected by the user.
